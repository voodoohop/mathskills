# Manga/Comic Style Update - COMPLETED ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Character Style Constant
**File:** `src/lib/rehype-pollinations-codefence.ts` (line 20)

**Before:**
```typescript
const CHARACTER_STYLE_PREFIX = "black and white cartoon mascot style, energetic shaggy dog with big floppy ears and friendly smile,";
```

**After:**
```typescript
const CHARACTER_STYLE_PREFIX = "manga comic book style, simple black and white ink drawing, expressive dog character with long floppy ears and dot eyes, clean linework, minimal details,";
```

### 2. Updated System Prompt
**File:** `src/content/systemPrompt.ts`

**Changes:**
- Line 34: Updated persona description to manga/comic style
- Line 88: Added style description: "Simple black and white ink drawing, expressive poses, clean linework, minimal details"
- Lines 94-114: Reorganized examples into two categories:
  - **Emotional/Motivational** (10 examples)
  - **Abstract Math Illustrations** (6 new examples)

### 3. New Abstract Math Illustration Examples

Added capability for AI to generate abstract visual metaphors for math concepts:

- Balancing two objects on a scale (for equations)
- Juggling geometric shapes (for multiple concepts)
- Climbing a ladder (for step-by-step progress)
- Looking through a magnifying glass at shapes (for analysis)
- Building blocks into a tower (for building knowledge)
- Standing next to abstract geometric patterns (for visual interest)

**Important Note:** Images are abstract and expressive, NOT for precise diagrams. GeoGebra should be used for labeled geometry, measurements, or specific mathematical diagrams.

## Style Reference

### Correct Style (Manga/Comic Book)
✅ **Manga/comic book style** - Simple, expressive linework  
✅ **Black and white ink drawing** - Clean, bold lines  
✅ **Simple but expressive** - Minimal details, maximum emotion  
✅ **Floppy ears** - Long, droopy dog ears  
✅ **Simple face** - Dot eyes, simple snout  
✅ **Expressive poses** - Hands/paws visible, body language clear  
✅ **Clean backgrounds** - Minimal or abstract, no detailed scenes

### What Changed from Previous Style
❌ **Old:** "cartoon mascot style, energetic shaggy dog"  
✅ **New:** "manga comic book style, simple black and white ink drawing, expressive dog with long floppy ears and dot eyes"

## Use Cases

### 1. Motivation & Encouragement
- Cheering students on
- Celebrating correct answers
- Providing emotional support
- Creating engagement

### 2. Abstract Math Concepts
- Visual metaphors for mathematical ideas
- Abstract representations (no labels/numbers)
- Conceptual illustrations
- Building understanding through imagery

### 3. NOT For
❌ Precise geometry diagrams  
❌ Labeled measurements  
❌ Specific mathematical calculations  
❌ Technical diagrams with legends

**Use GeoGebra for precise mathematical visualizations.**

## Build Status
✅ Build succeeds (npm run build)  
✅ No TypeScript errors  
✅ Dev server running on port 5174  
✅ Ready for deployment

## Testing Next Steps

1. **Test with AI** - Generate images with simple prompts like:
   - "cheering happily"
   - "thinking deeply"
   - "balancing objects on scale"
   
2. **Verify style** - Check that generated images match manga/comic reference (Image 4)

3. **Test abstract concepts** - Try math metaphor prompts:
   - "juggling geometric shapes"
   - "climbing ladder"
   - "building blocks tower"

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/rehype-pollinations-codefence.ts` - Style constant (line 20)
2. `/src/content/systemPrompt.ts` - Character description and examples (lines 34, 88, 94-114)

## Architecture Remains Clean
✅ Style separated into constant (easy to change)  
✅ Actions in code fences (AI writes simple prompts)  
✅ Plugin handles URL generation automatically  
✅ No AI refusal issues (code fence approach works)

## Next Session
- Test generated images to verify manga/comic style
- Adjust style constant if needed based on results
- Add more abstract math illustration examples if useful
