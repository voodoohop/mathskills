## What Changed

**Before:**
- Prompt: `shaggy dog cheering happily`
- Result: Realistic/photorealistic furry dog

**After:**
- Prompt: `black and white cartoon silhouette style, shaggy dog with floppy ears, cheering happily`
- Expected Result: Black and white cartoon silhouette matching reference image

## Style Keywords Added
- `black and white` - Enforces monochrome palette
- `cartoon` - Enforces cartoon/illustrated style (not photorealistic)
- `silhouette style` - Enforces simplified shapes like the reference image
- `shaggy dog with floppy ears` - Character description

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the app in browser
2. Start a conversation
3. Trigger an image (e.g., answer correctly)
4. Check if the generated image matches the black and white cartoon style
5. If not, we may need to adjust the style descriptors further

## Alternative Style Descriptors (if needed)

If the current prompt doesn't work well, try these variations:

### Option 1: More explicit
```
minimalist black and white cartoon, simple silhouette, shaggy dog with floppy ears, [action]
```

### Option 2: Reference specific style
```
black and white line art, cartoon dog silhouette, shaggy with floppy ears, [action]
```

### Option 3: Emphasize simplicity
```
simple black and white cartoon, silhouette style dog with floppy ears, [action]
```

### Option 4: Vector style
```

```
