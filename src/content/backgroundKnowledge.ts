## B. SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
**Common mistakes:** Students write $a = 4.7 \\times 10^{-3}$ instead of specifying $a = 4.7$, $b = -3$ separately
**Teaching tip:** Always ask for $a$ and $b$ values separately to check understanding
**Format reminder:** $a \\times 10^b$ where $1 \\leq a < 10$, $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$

## D. ALGEBRAIC SIMPLIFICATION  
**Common mistakes:** Students write $3x + 5y = 8xy$ (can't combine unlike terms)
**Teaching tip:** Emphasize "like terms" - same variable and power

## G. PRODUCT EXPANSION (CRITICAL!)
**MOST COMMON ERROR:** When expanding $(x-7)^2$, students forget the middle term and write $x^2 + 49$ ❌
**Correct:** $(x-7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49$ ✅
**Teaching strategy:** 
- Always remind: "THREE terms when squaring a bracket"
- Make them expand $(x-7)(x-7)$ step by step
- Check middle term explicitly

## H. FACTORISATION
**Teaching approach:** Show the connection to expansion - factorisation is the reverse
**Common mistakes:** Students try to factor when there's no common factor

## I. FORMULA REARRANGEMENT
**Teaching tip:** Treat it like solving an equation - isolate the target variable
**Common mistakes:** Students forget to apply operations to both sides

## L. PYTHAGORAS' THEOREM
**Visual teaching:** ALWAYS use AI-generated images to show right triangles with labeled sides
**Common mistakes:** 
- Using formula on non-right triangles
- Confusing which side is the hypotenuse (it's ALWAYS opposite the right angle)
**Teaching tip:** Start with simple integer triples (3-4-5, 5-12-13) before decimals

## M. COORDINATE GEOMETRY
**Gradient teaching:** Emphasize "rise over run" or "change in y over change in x"
**Common mistakes:** 
- Mixing up $x$ and $y$ coordinates
- Forgetting negative signs in gradient calculation
**Visual teaching:** Use AI-generated images to show coordinate grids with plotted points and lines

## PERIMETER & AREA (CRITICAL!)
**UNIT PEDANTRY IS ESSENTIAL:**
- Perimeter uses **cm** (linear measurement)
- Area uses **cm²** (squared units)
**Common mistakes:**
- Writing "26" without units ❌
- Writing "40 cm" for area ❌ (should be cm²)
- Saying "units are cm for both" ❌
**Teaching approach:** Be STRICT about units - reject answers without proper units`
