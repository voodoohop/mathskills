## A. SURDS AND RADICALS

### Definitions
- A **radical** is any number written with the radical sign √
- A **surd** is a real, irrational radical such as √2, √3, √5, or √6
- √4 is a radical but NOT a surd (it simplifies to 2)
- √a is the non-negative number such that √a × √a = a

### Properties
- √a is never negative, so √a ≥ 0
- √a is meaningful only for a ≥ 0
- √(ab) = √a × √b for a ≥ 0 and b ≥ 0
- √(a/b) = √a/√b for a ≥ 0 and b ≥ 0

### Examples
- √2 × √3 = √6
- √(18/6) = √3

### Simplifying Surds
- Compare with algebra: 2x - 5x = -3x
- Similarly: 3√3 + 5√3 = 8√3
- 2√2 - 5√2 = -3√2

### Writing in Simplest Form
To write √18 in the form a√b:
- √18 = √(9 × 2) = √9 × √2 = 3√2

### Rationalizing the Denominator
To write √(9/3) without a radical in the denominator:
- √(9/3) × √3/√3 = (9√3)/3 = 3√3

## B. SCIENTIFIC NOTATION (STANDARD FORM)

### Definition
Scientific notation involves writing any number as:
- **a × 10^k** where 1 ≤ a < 10 and k ∈ ℤ

### Examples
**Converting to Scientific Notation:**
- 37,600 = 3.76 × 10,000 = 3.76 × 10⁴
- 0.00086 = 8.6 ÷ 10,000 = 8.6 × 10⁻⁴

**Converting from Scientific Notation:**
- 3.2 × 10² = 320
- 5.76 × 10⁻⁵ = 0.0000576

### Applications
- Distance from Earth to Sun: 149,500,000,000 m = 1.495 × 10¹¹ m
- Bacteria diameter: 0.0003 mm = 3 × 10⁻⁴ mm
- Speed of light: 3 × 10⁸ m/s

## C. NUMBER SYSTEMS AND SET NOTATION

### Number Systems
- **ℝ** = set of all real numbers (all numbers on the number line)
- **ℕ** = set of natural numbers = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}
- **ℤ** = set of integers = {0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ...}
- **ℤ⁺** = set of positive integers = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
- **ℚ** = set of rational numbers = {p/q where p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0}

### Set Notation
- {x | -3 < x < 2} reads "the set of all values that x can be such that x lies between -3 and 2"
- {x | x > 5, x ∈ ℝ} = "the set of all real x such that x is greater than 5"
- {x | 1 ≤ x ≤ 4, x ∈ ℕ} = the set {1, 2, 3, 4}

---

## D. ALGEBRAIC SIMPLIFICATION

### Key Rules
- **Distributive law:** a(b + c) = ab + ac
- **Power notation:** a² = a × a, a³ = a × a × a, etc.

### Examples
- 3x + 7x - 10 = 10x - 10
- 7ab + 5ba = 12ab
- 3(2x + 5) + 4(5 + 4x) = 6x + 15 + 20 + 16x = 22x + 35

---

## E. LINEAR EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES

### Rules for Inequalities
- Multiplying or dividing both sides by a **negative** reverses the inequality sign
- Do NOT multiply or divide both sides by the unknown

### Examples
**Solving Equations:**
- 2x + 5 = 25 → x = 10
- 3x - 7 > 11 → x > 6

**Simultaneous Equations:**
- x + 2y = 9
- x - y = 3
- Solution: x = 5, y = 2

---

## F. MODULUS OR ABSOLUTE VALUE

### Definition
The modulus of a real number is its **size, ignoring its sign**.

### Notation
- |x| denotes the modulus of x
- |7| = 7
- |-7| = 7

### Geometric Definition
|x| is the distance of x from 0 on the number line

### Algebraic Definition
|x| = {x if x ≥ 0; -x if x < 0}

Or: |x| = √(x²)

### Distance Interpretation
|x - a| can be considered as "the distance of x from a"

### Solving Modulus Equations
If |x| = a where a > 0, then **x = ±a**

Examples:
- |x| = 3 → x = 3 or x = -3
- |x - 1| = 3 → x = 4 or x = -2

---

## G. PRODUCT EXPANSION

### Expansion Rules
1. **(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd**
2. **(a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²** (difference of two squares)
3. **(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²** (perfect squares)

### Examples
**(2x + 1)(x + 3)**
- = 2x² + 6x + x + 3
- = 2x² + 7x + 3

**(5x - 2)(5x + 2)**
- = (5x)² - 2²
- = 25x² - 4

**(x + 2)²**
- = x² + 2(x)(2) + 2²
- = x² + 4x + 4

---

## H. FACTORISATION

Factorisation is the **reverse process of expansion**.

### Flow Chart for Factorising
1. Take out any common factors
2. Recognize type:
   - Difference of two squares: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)
   - Perfect square: a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²
   - Sum and Product type: x² + bx + c = (x + p)(x + q) where p + q = b and pq = c
   - General quadratic: ax² + bx + c (use splitting method)

### Examples

**Common Factors:**
- 3x² - 12x = 3x(x - 4)

**Difference of Two Squares:**
- 4x² - 1 = (2x + 1)(2x - 1)

**Perfect Squares:**
- x² - 12x + 36 = (x - 6)²

**Sum and Product:**
- x² + 9x + 8 = (x + 8)(x + 1)

### Splitting the x-term Method
For **ax² + bx + c**:
1. Find ac
2. Find factors of ac that add to b
3. If these factors are p and q, replace bx by px + qx
4. Complete the factorisation

**Example: 2x² - x - 10**
- ac = 2 × (-10) = -20
- Factors of -20 that add to -1: -5 and +4
- 2x² - 5x + 4x - 10
- = x(2x - 5) + 2(2x - 5)
- = (2x - 5)(x + 2)

---

## I. FORMULA REARRANGEMENT

### Process
To make a variable the subject of a formula, use standard equation-solving techniques.

### Examples

**Make x the subject of D = xt + p:**
- D = xt + p
- D - p = xt
- x = (D - p)/t

**Make z the subject of c = m/z:**
- c = m/z
- cz = m
- z = m/c

**Make t the subject of s = ½gt² (where t > 0):**
- ½gt² = s
- gt² = 2s
- t² = 2s/g
- t = √(2s/g)

---

## J. ADDING AND SUBTRACTING ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS

### Method
Combine fractions into a single fraction with the **least common denominator (LCD)**.

### Examples

**2 + 3/x:**
- = 2(x/x) + 3/x
- = (2x + 3)/x

**(x - 1)/3 - (x + 3)/2:**
- LCD = 6
- = 2(x - 1)/6 - 3(x + 3)/6
- = (2x - 2 - 3x - 9)/6
- = (-x - 11)/6

**(3x + 1)/(x - 2) - 2:**
- LCD = (x - 2)
- = (3x + 1)/(x - 2) - 2(x - 2)/(x - 2)
- = (3x + 1 - 2x + 4)/(x - 2)
- = (x + 5)/(x - 2)

## K. CONGRUENCE AND SIMILARITY

### Congruence
Two triangles are **congruent** if they are identical in every respect apart from position (same shape and size).

**Tests for Congruence:**
1. **SSS:** All three corresponding sides are equal
2. **SAS:** Two sides and the included angle are equal
3. **AAcorS:** Two angles and a corresponding side are equal
4. **RHS:** For right-angled triangles, hypotenuse and one other side are equal

### Similarity
Two triangles are **similar** if one is an enlargement of the other.
- Similar triangles are equiangular
- Corresponding sides are in the same ratio

**Example:**
If triangles are similar with sides in ratio 2:3, and one triangle has a side of 6 cm, the corresponding side in the other triangle is 9 cm.

## L. PYTHAGORAS' THEOREM

### Statement
In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

**c² = a² + b²**

Where:
- c = hypotenuse (longest side, opposite the right angle)
- a, b = other two sides

### Converse
If a triangle has sides of length a, b, c and a² + b² = c², then the triangle is right-angled.

### Examples

**Finding the hypotenuse:**
- If a = 0.8 m and b = 1 m
- x² = 0.8² + 1²
- x = √(0.64 + 1) = √1.64 ≈ 1.28 m

**Finding a shorter side:**
- If c = 5 m and b = 1.7 m
- x² + 1.7² = 5²
- x² = 25 - 2.89
- x = √22.11 ≈ 4.70 m

### 3-D Applications
Often requires using Pythagoras' theorem twice:
- First in one plane to find an intermediate length
- Then in another plane to find the final answer

## M. COORDINATE GEOMETRY

### The Number Plane
- Also called: Cartesian plane or 2-dimensional plane
- **Origin:** Point O at (0, 0)
- **x-axis:** Horizontal axis
- **y-axis:** Vertical axis
- **Ordered pair:** (a, b) where a is x-coordinate, b is y-coordinate

### Distance Formula
If A(x₁, y₁) and B(x₂, y₂) are two points:

**AB = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]**

### Midpoint Formula
If M is the midpoint of [AB]:

**M = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2)**

### Gradient (Slope) of a Line
If A is (x₁, y₁) and B is (x₂, y₂):

**gradient = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)**

**Properties:**
- Horizontal lines: gradient = 0
- Vertical lines: gradient is undefined
- Forward sloping lines: positive gradient
- Backward sloping lines: negative gradient
- Parallel lines: equal gradients
- Perpendicular lines: m₁m₂ = -1 (gradients are negative reciprocals)

### Equations of Lines

**Vertical line:** x = a

**Horizontal line:** y = c

**Point-gradient form:** y - b = m(x - a)
- For a line through (a, b) with gradient m

**Gradient-intercept form:** y = mx + c
- m = gradient, c = y-intercept

**General form:** Ax - By = C

### Axes Intercepts
- **x-intercept:** Let y = 0 and solve for x
- **y-intercept:** Let x = 0 and solve for y

### Point on a Line
A point lies on a line if its coordinates **satisfy the equation** of the line.

## N. RIGHT ANGLED TRIANGLE TRIGONOMETRY

### Labelling Right Angled Triangles
For angle θ:
- **HYP (Hypotenuse):** Opposite the right angle (longest side)
- **OPP (Opposite):** Side opposite angle θ
- **ADJ (Adjacent):** Side adjacent to angle θ

### Three Basic Trigonometric Ratios

**sin θ = OPP/HYP**

**cos θ = ADJ/HYP**

**tan θ = OPP/ADJ**

### Common Trigonometric Ratios

| θ | 0° | 30° | 45° | 60° | 90° |
|---|----|----|----|----|-----|
| sin θ | 0 | 1/2 | 1/√2 | √3/2 | 1 |
| cos θ | 1 | √3/2 | 1/√2 | 1/2 | 0 |
| tan θ | 0 | 1/√3 | 1 | √3 | undefined |

### Finding Angles
**Inverse Trigonometric Functions:**
- If sin θ = a/b, then θ = sin⁻¹(a/b)
- If cos θ = a/b, then θ = cos⁻¹(a/b)
- If tan θ = a/b, then θ = tan⁻¹(a/b)

Alternative notation: arcsin, arccos, arctan

### Applications

**Angle of Elevation:** Angle above the horizontal

**Angle of Depression:** Angle below the horizontal

**Isosceles Triangles:** Draw perpendicular from apex to base (which bisects the base)

**Problem Solving:** Used for finding heights and distances that are difficult to measure directly
